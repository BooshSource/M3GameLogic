# M3GameLogic
This is a Game logic compiler/decompiler for Mother 3.
For now it just supports decompiling.
It requires passing in input the path to the ROM.
Standard output is fully working and goes to GameLogic.txt.
The g option makes it use a graph logic, which isn't fully working but could be useful to analyze some code.
To use it, type your path to the ROM and then "g".
